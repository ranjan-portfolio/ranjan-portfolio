- 🤓 Geek Fun Fact: The first computer bug was an actual bug! 🐛💻

In 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer found that a moth had gotten stuck in a relay, causing a malfunction. They taped the moth into the logbook and labeled it "First actual case of bug being found."

And that’s how we got the term "debugging"! 🚀
